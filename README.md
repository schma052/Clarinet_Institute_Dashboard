# Online Digital Retailer Dashboard
Business Intelligence Dashboard for the Online Digital Retailer

This dashboard was created to delve into revenue, customer, geaographical, and product data. It is designed to be continuously updated by csv files from payhip and weebly, services the Online Digital Retailer uses to sell product. 

The dashboard revealed the need to add additional lines of marketing and modify existing forms to better target consumers and reduce unsubscription rates. 

To view this dashboard, download the two csv files provided, then re-upload them when propted. 
Special thanks for allowing this sensored, but real data to be posted for example. Best viewed in light mode.
