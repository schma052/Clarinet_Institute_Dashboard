# Clarinet Institute Dashboard
Business Intelligence Dashboard for the Clarinet Institute

This dashboard was created to delve into revenue, customer, geaographical, and product data. It is designed to be continuously updated by csv files from payhip and weebly, services the Clarinet Institute uses to sell product. 

The dashboard revealed the need to add additional lines of marketing and modify existing forms to better target consumers and reduce unsubscription rates. 

Special thanks for allowing this sensored, but real data to be posted for example. Best viewed in light mode.
